# HearthStone Deck Search
Easily view HearthStone Decks

View Here: https://samuraicarm.github.io/deckViewer/

Purpose: API Capstone for Bloc web development bootcamp

Project Summary:
If you are new to the game Hearthstone, itâ€™s hard to know how to start building decks. Although learning comes from trial and error, this project will allow players to view exsisting decks and try them out in the game to help them explore their playstyle. This experience is meant to add more context to the cards and deck building and give players more confidence to play.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JQUERY, JAVASCRIPT

This was made using the Hearthstone API. View the documentation here: https://develop.battle.net/documentation/hearthstone

How it works:
On load the page will show a default deck, from there you can enter a Hearthstone Deck code or press the random button to view a random deck. For your convience, I've listed a few Hearthstone codes below. You can also take these codes and use them in Hearthstone on PC or your phone.

A completed Heartstone deck contains 30 cards. Duplicate cards can exist in decks. 

To pull your own Hearthstone deck codes: 
    1. Select My Collection
    2. Under My Decks select a deck
    3. Once the deck loads, click on the deck class a menu will appear
    4. Click COPY to copy the deck id to your clipboard
